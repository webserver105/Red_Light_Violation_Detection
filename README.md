# Red_Light_Violation_Detection
Red Light Violation Detection System uses a YOLOv8s model and DeepSORT to detect vehicles and traffic lights in real-time. It identifies red light violations, records short video clips, logs details in CSV files, and supports both live camera and video upload through a Flask-based web interface.
