## Motivation
This project was built during my internship to solve a real-world problem: Detecting Red Light Traffic Violations.\
It uses computer vision to automate the monitoring process and aims to improve road safety by reducing manual surveillance efforts

## Introduction
Urban traffic violations like red-light jumping are a growing concern, leading to accidents and safety risks. Manual enforcement alone is not enough. This system uses YOLOv8 and DeepSORT to detect red light violations in real-time and helps authorities enforce rules more effectively. It features a web interface that logs violations with clips and timestamps, making monitoring both efficient and user-friendly.
## Features

- Vehicle detection using YOLOv8 trained on **BDD100K** dataset  
- Traffic light color classification using YOLOv8 trained on **BSTLD** dataset  
- Vehicle tracking using **DeepSORT** for consistent ID across frames  
- Polygon-based violation zone detection logic  
- Records MP4 clips of red light violations  
- Logs violations in CSV with timestamp, class, and ID  
- Web interface built with Flask (upload or live camera)  
- Clean and organized output folder for logs and clips

### Installation & Usage
**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/webserver105/Red_Light_Violation_Detection
cd red_light_violation_detection
```
**2. Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**3. Usage:**
```bash
python app.py
```
