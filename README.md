## Motivation
This project was built during my internship to solve a real-world problem: Detecting Red Light Traffic Violations.\
It uses computer vision to automate the monitoring process and aims to improve road safety by reducing manual surveillance efforts

## About the Project

This project is a real-time **Red Light Violation Detection System**. It uses two YOLOv8 models—one for vehicle detection and another for traffic light detection and state classification—and tracks vehicle movements using **DeepSORT**. The system automatically saves logs and video clips of vehicles that enters violation zone when the traffic light is red. It supports both video file input and live camera feeds.

## Features

- Vehicle detection using YOLOv8 trained on **BDD100K** dataset  
- Traffic light color classification using YOLOv8 trained on **BSTLD** dataset  
- Vehicle tracking using **DeepSORT** for consistent ID across frames  
- Polygon-based violation zone detection logic  
- Records MP4 clips of red light violations  
- Logs violations in CSV with timestamp, class, and ID  
- Web interface built with Flask (upload or live camera)  
- Clean and organized output folder for logs and clips

## Sample Output

![Violation Example](sample_output.jpg)  
*Vehicle crosses violation zone while the light is red. System logs the clip and details.*

### Installation & Usage
**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/webserver105/Red_Light_Violation_Detection
cd red_light_violation_detection
```
**2. Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**3. Usage:**
```bash
python app.py
```
